InterXAI brings together scholars, developers, and critics to reimagine Explainable AI (XAI) through the lens of human-centered design and **intertextual analysis**. We believe explanations aren't just for machines—they’re for people. 

By linking **literary methods** with **technical interpretation**, we aim to reveal the layered meanings in model behavior, decisions, and narratives.

## 🧭 Why Intertextuality?

Modern AI explanations often miss the **human texture**—the narratives, biases, and values that shape understanding. Intertextual critique bridges that gap, inviting diverse voices into the meaning-making process of AI behavior.

By examining **text reuse, metaphors, references, or alternative framings**, we unlock a richer interpretive layer behind machine logic.
