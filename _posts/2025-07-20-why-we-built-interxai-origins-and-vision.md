The InterXAI project was born out of a critical need: bridging the gap between humanistic critique and the rapidly evolving field of Explainable AI (XAI). While XAI tools can output probabilities, saliency maps, or attention visualizations, their interpretability still lags behind the nuance found in literary or cultural criticism.

Intertextualityâ€”the shaping of a text's meaning by other textsâ€”offers a rich metaphor and methodology for enhancing human-centered AI evaluation. With InterXAI, we aim to combine algorithmic explanation with critical interpretation, making AI outputs not only understandable but contextually meaningful.

In this post, we share how our background in digital humanities, natural language processing, and human-centered design inspired this initiative.
