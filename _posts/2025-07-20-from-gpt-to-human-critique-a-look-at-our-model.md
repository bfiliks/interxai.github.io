title: "From GPT to Human Critique: A Look at Our Model"
date: 2025-07-20

Our InterXAI pipeline combines three layers of interpretation:

1. **Model Explanation (e.g., SHAP, LIME, attention weights)**
2. **Human Commentary (scholarly or critical notes)**
3. **Intertextual Overlay (matching or clashing sources)**

In this post, we provide an overview of our architecture—from GPT-based content generation to side-by-side comparison with curated human annotations.

We believe this hybrid approach opens up a new form of critical XAI that’s especially useful in education, ethics, and digital humanities research.
