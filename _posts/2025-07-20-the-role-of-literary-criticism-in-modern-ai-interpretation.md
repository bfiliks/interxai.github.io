What can literary criticism teach us about AI?

Quite a lot. From formalist analysis to post-structuralist critique, the tools used to interpret texts can help us scrutinize the â€˜black boxâ€™ of machine learning models.

In this post, we reflect on:
- Structuralism and pattern-seeking in model outputs
- Post-colonial critique and dataset bias
- Reader-response theory as human-AI feedback loop

InterXAI builds on these insights to champion explanation methods that arenâ€™t just technicalâ€”but thoughtful, situated, and critical.
