# 📄 InterXAI White Paper

## Reimagining Explainable AI through Intertextual Critique  
*Version 1.0 – July 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

**InterXAI** is a human-centered platform that bridges Explainable AI (XAI) and intertextual analysis. It empowers users to compare machine-generated model explanations with human interpretations, fostering critical engagement, accountability, and enriched understanding of AI behavior.

Combining computational linguistics, literary methods, and digital humanities, InterXAI offers a hybrid framework for interpretability and critique in machine learning systems.

---

## 1. Vision & Purpose

Modern AI systems are increasingly opaque, and existing XAI tools often center the machine’s perspective. InterXAI flips the lens. We ask not just *how* a model works—but *how* its outputs are interpreted, challenged, and reframed by human users.

By drawing from hermeneutics, reader-response theory, and intertextuality, InterXAI provides a method to analyze, visualize, and question AI decisions in light of cultural, ethical, and narrative frames.

## 2. Core Features

### 🧠 XAI Engine
- Integrates SHAP, LIME, and other ML explanation libraries  
- Provides model-level explanations of classification, regression, and generative outputs  
- API-ready and extendable to vision and multi-modal models

### ✋ Human Annotation Engine
- Allows annotators to critique, contextualize, or reframe model outputs  
- Supports tagging of metaphors, references, omissions, and alternative interpretations  
- Tracks consensus or divergence across multiple readers

### 🔗 Intertextual Linker
- Links model outputs to external corpora (e.g., Wikipedia, classic texts, media archives)  
- Highlights allusions, reused phrasing, or conceptual drift  
- Integrates with NLP pipelines for text similarity and citation detection

### 🧲 Comparison Orchestrator
- Merges machine and human insights side-by-side  
- Detects gaps between technical explanations and human critiques  
- Generates visual dashboards and exportable insights

## 3. Use Cases

- **Education**: Teaching AI literacy and critical thinking via annotated model outputs  
- **Digital Humanities**: Analyzing AI-generated interpretations of historical or literary texts  
- **Media & Ethics**: Auditing content recommendation or moderation explanations  
- **NLP Research**: Comparing generated text explanations with scholarly commentary  
- **Policy & Compliance**: Visualizing accountability in high-stakes automated decisions
