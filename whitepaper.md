# InterXAI White Paper

## Reimagining Explainable AI through Intertextual Critique  
*Version 1.0 ‚Äì July 2025*

---

## Executive Summary
InterXAI is a human-centered platform that bridges Explainable AI (XAI) and intertextual analysis. It empowers users to compare machine-generated model explanations with human interpretations, fostering critical engagement, accountability, and enriched understanding of AI behavior. Combining computational linguistics, literary methods, and digital humanities, InterXAI offers a hybrid framework for interpretability and critique in machine learning systems.

---

## 1. Vision & Purpose
Modern AI systems are increasingly opaque, and existing XAI tools often center the machine‚Äôs perspective. InterXAI flips the lens. We ask not just *how* a model works‚Äîbut *how* its outputs are interpreted, challenged, and reframed by human users.

By drawing from fields like hermeneutics, reader-response theory, and intertextuality, InterXAI offers a method to analyze, visualize, and question AI decisions in light of cultural, ethical, and narrative frames.

## 2. Core Features

### üß† XAI Engine
- Integrates SHAP, LIME, and other ML explanation libraries  
- Provides model-level explanations of classification, regression, and generative outputs  
- API-ready and extendable to vision and multi-modal models

### ‚úã Human Annotation Engine
- Allows annotators to critique, contextualize, or reframe model outputs  
- Supports tagging of metaphors, references, omissions, and alternative interpretations  
- Tracks consensus or divergence across multiple readers

### üîó Intertextual Linker
- Links model outputs to external corpora (e.g., Wikipedia, classic texts, media archives)  
- Highlights allusions, reused phrasing, or conceptual drift  
- Integrates with existing NLP pipelines for text similarity and citation detection

### üß≤ Comparison Orchestrator
- Merges machine and human insights side-by-side  
- Detects gaps between technical explanations and human critiques  
- Generates visual dashboards and exportable insights
